  x Maybe not do this
  o Thing to do
  + Thing that I MUST do
  F Figure


=== TODO ===

  o Make presentation for Monday

    === Pres for Monday
      o Top 10 of all
      o Also drivers/xx subsystems

    === Read about
      o TypeChef. What is it, 


    === Write about
      o the UM (Linux User Mode) arch
      o manyoptions choice. There is only one (USB Gadget Drivers).
        Write about how useless it is...
      o Write about why I do not cross compile, and what archs I can compile for
      o That make always runs `gcc -Wall` (I found out that 55/2000 times it 
        does not run -Wall but only `gcc`
      o Maybe I should have put `gcc -Wextra`
      o Find out the number of HAVE_XXXs, because those are maybe not `real` 
        features.
      o mtlab.itu.dk being able to unpack it all in RAM.
      o Write the Backus Naur Form of the Kconfig syntactic language.
      o Abstract Syntax Trees and parsers (is randconfig a parser?)
      o Version of gcc, and that a lot has happened lately (Some are compiled 
        with 4.9, and others with 5.1)
          o I hope, that I have noted this down somewhere.
      o Makefiles
         Fx Maybe make a graph showing the order of commands that are needed to 
            run. `make config (makefiles)` -> `gcc` -> `make (makefiles)` -> 
            `gcc`
      o How to unclause a choice option
      F Figure of how the permutation can be. something with aggregates of 7 
        layers, and then showing either the top level scrambled, or all of them 
        scrambled.
      o I used kconfiglib, but not for much
      o Permutations didnt do squat. ( I think)
      o `randconfig` will sometimes make an invalid config (25% actually)
      o Sketch up how Jaccard similarity can be used to find the features that 
        cause a specific error.




    === Programming wise
      + Backup the database
      o Remove bogus data from database
      o Start a generate n filter instance to find the number of valid configs
          o Can I figure it out logically? 
          x Or start a script (that has no crossconstraints) that increases the 
            amount of features, and then checks how many are valid

      + Try to run some configs and running `mrproper` between them.
        Then run the same configs, and do not run `mrproper` in between.
        Is the warning output the same?
      + Test if randconfig does not consider features that does not have a 
        description. If it does not, all the data might be kind of bogus.
      o Make test configs and permute them to see that it wont do squat.
      o Does randconfig always take the default values?
      o If I run `make allnoconfig`, what are the `int` and `string` values set 
        to?
      o Is the preprocessed code stored on HDD after compilation
      x Do Jaccard similarity to find out what features cause the same errors.
