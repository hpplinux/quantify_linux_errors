### TODO

  * Try to get it to make some errors, and make it report back in the format we
    want (see section 'ERROR DATA')
      - I have started on the regular expressions, but they are not all done. I
        only get half of the errors on the regexps.
  * Find out if running `make` actually runs `gcc -Wall`
      - maybe [5](ntu.edu.sg) can help figure something out
      - It looks like that both busybox and linuxkernel uses the -Wall flags in
        their makefiles. But I guess there are like multiple 100s of makefiles
        that I will have to check if all are using the  -Wall flag?
  * Go back to version python 3.0 you silly.

### DONE

  * Download the 'BusyBox' code, and experiment on that. It is not as big, and
    is therefore faster to compile.
    [DONE!]

### QUESTIONS

  * Does `make randomconfig` always make a valid config file?
      - Shall I do some Kconfig validity testing?
  * Can I replicate one of the bugs from VBDb.itu.dk?
      - How can I tell what kernel version the commits are from?
  * What kind of bugs can `cgg -Wall` find?
      - Look at [3](gnu.org), it states what types of errors `gcc -Wall` will 
        find.
      ! But maybe start by defining what types of errors I would like. Maybe use
        the types they use in [4](VBDb.itu.dk).

### ERROR DATA

[config, 
    analyzer used, 
    buginfo: [
        line no, 
        filename, 
        error type,
        error message ]
    derived bug info: [
        Location in code ] ]

    Which can probably come in handy at some point.
