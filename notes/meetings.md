Next time
---------
Look into the HAVE_FOO_BAR configs.
Look into the choice options. how to un-clause them
Remember to save what architecture is being compiled for.
Look into the AST (bison and maybe yacc)
github:ulfalizer/Kconfiglib
look into the "target <> not remade because of errors" error just to understand what it means.

Take an error from a configuration with no configuration errors.
    And go into depth with it.
    and find the place in the code and make sure, that it is indeed uninitialized.
    (or what error it was)
    make a "simplified bug" so we can see when it is defined, initialized, and  so on
        and check with the configuration and the ifdefs.
        Just like in the vbdb.itu.dk
