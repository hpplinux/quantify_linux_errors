# Quantifying Errors in Linux Kernel
Elvis' master thesis

## Dependencies
python3 (maybe older versions will work)
bash
gcc (or build-tools, or whatever it is called in your distribution)
GNU time (not built-in bash-time or zsh-time, but GNU time)


## Timing of the compiling process
GNU time is used in stead of the normal built-in time command. This is mainly 
to make it easier to get the time into a specific file, and in the format we 
want.
